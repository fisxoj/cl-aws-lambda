#+TITLE: Example lambda
* Getting started
  1. To deploy this example lambda, you will need:
     - Docker
     - zip
     - awscli

  2. Furthermore, you'll need an AWS account with a basic lambda role defined.  AWS has a [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html][Getting Started with AWS Lambda]] guide that might be useful for you, at this point.

  3. Once you have created a [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html][role]] for your lambda, use the ~cp .env.default .env~ and edit the file to set the role ARN for your lambda.  You can also override the other variables in the ~Makefile~, here, if you wish.

  4. With your ARN set, you should be able to compile and deploy the example lambda.  Run ~make deploy~, which should compile your lambda in docker (so we have a sufficiently new version of sbcl), zip it into ~function.zip~ and then create a lambda in AWS by uploading that zip as a custom runtime using the aws cli tool.

  5. You should now be able to run ~make invoke~, which will call your lambda with the aws cli to ask it to say hello to me.  Thank you for saying hello to me.

  6. If you want to, you can change the code of ~hello.lisp~ and then run ~make update~ to recompile and update your lambda function.

  Deleting a lambda is left as an exercise to the reader, I guess.
